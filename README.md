#### [ExoPlayer AirPlay Receiver](https://github.com/warren-bank/Android-ExoPlayer-AirPlay-Receiver)
##### (less formally named: _"ExoAirPlayer"_)

Android app to run on a set-top box and play video URLs "cast" to it with a stateless HTTP API (based on AirPlay v1).

- - - -

#### Overview:

There is no UI when the app starts.
It's a foreground service with a notification, which runs a web server on port 8192.
The IP address of the server is given in the notification message.

When a video URL is "cast" to the server, a video player opens full-screen.

When an audio URL is "cast" to the server, the music plays in the background.. even when the screen is off.

When either audio or video media is playing and the player's window doesn't have focus
(ex: listening to background audio, or by pressing the "home" button while watching a video),
another notification is added to control playback or refocus the player's window.

[This page](http://webcast-reloaded.surge.sh/airplay_sender.html) is the simplest way to send signals to a running instance,
though other ["high level" tools](#usage-high-level) exist to capture media URLs from the wild.

Audio or video files/playlists can also be started directly from the Android file system,
which makes this app a very suitable replacement for a general-purpose video player.

Playlists can be generated dynamically from:
* a single directory in the Android file system
* a recursive directory tree in the Android file system
* any HTML page with anchor tags that link to media files
  - very useful for playing files from a remote directory listing

Playlists can be read explicitly from any text file with an `.m3u` file extension,
which lists one media item path per line:
* the `.m3u` file can be read from either the Android file system or a remote URL
* each item path can refer to either the Android file system or a remote URL

When a video file is played from the Android file system,
its directory is automatically scanned for matching subtitle file(s).
A match will have the same filename and any of the following extensions: `srt,ttml,vtt,webvtt,ssa,ass`.
Nested extension(s) can optionally be used to distinguish between [different languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation#Language_tags_and_codes) (ex: `.en-US.srt`, `.es-MX.vtt`).

#### Background:

* I use Chromecasts _a lot_
  - they are incredibly adaptable
    * though their protocol is [proprietary and locked down](https://blog.oakbits.com/google-cast-protocol-receiver-authentication.html)
  - I very rarely cast video from Android apps
    * though the [Google Cast SDK for Android](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/android_sender) is nearly ubiquitous
  - I find much better video content to stream on websites, and wrote some tools to identify and cast these URLs
    * [_WebCast-Reloaded_ Chrome extension](https://github.com/warren-bank/crx-webcast-reloaded) to use with desktop web browsers
    * [_WebCast_ Android app](https://github.com/warren-bank/Android-WebCast) to use with mobile devices
* I also really like using Android set-top boxes
  - mainly to play video files stored on an attached drive
  - they are incredibly adaptable
    * able to run any Android apk, such as:
      - VPN client
      - torrent client
      - FTP client
      - HTTP server
* I thought it would be "fun" to write an app to run on Android set-top boxes that could provide the same functionality that I enjoy on Chromecasts
  - and will work equally well on smaller screens (ex: phones and tablets)

#### Scope:

* the goal is __not__ to provide an app that is recognized on the LAN as a virtual Chromecast device
  - [CheapCast](https://github.com/mauimauer/cheapcast) accomplished this in 2013
    * Google quickly [changed its protocol](https://blog.oakbits.com/google-cast-protocol-discovery-and-connection.html)
* AirPlay v1 uses a very simple stateless [HTTP API](http://nto.github.io/AirPlay.html#video)
  - this is a great starting point
    * it supports: play, pause, seek, stop
  - I'd like to extend this API (for a custom sender)
    * to add support for:
      - video queue, next, previous, mute, set volume
      - audio playlists (_m3u_, _html_ directory index)

#### Design:

* [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer)
  - media player used to render video URLs
* [HttpCore](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-core-ga/)
  - low level HTTP transport components used to build a custom HTTP service
* [jmDNS](https://github.com/jmdns/jmdns)
  - multi-cast DNS service registration used to make the AirPlay v1 compatible HTTP service discoverable on LAN

* [_Bookmarks_ Android app](https://github.com/warren-bank/Android-Bookmarks) that is open-source, and can be used to:
  - configure [_Intents_](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent) that broadcast [media key events](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent) to _ExoAirPlayer_&hellip; running on the same device
    * example:
      - _Name_ = `stop`
      - _Package Name_ = `com.github.warren_bank.exoplayer_airplay_receiver`
      - _Class Name_ = `androidx.media.session.MediaButtonReceiver`
      - _Action_ = `android.intent.action.MEDIA_BUTTON`
      - extra:
        * _Name_ = `android.intent.extra.KEY_EVENT`
        * _Type of Value_ = `int`
        * _Value_ = [`86`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent#KEYCODE_MEDIA_STOP)
    * notes:
      - this example configures an _explicit_ Intent
      - Android 8.0+ [does not allow](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcast-exceptions) any app to receive _implicit_ broadcasts for media key events
      - if _ExoAirPlayer_ is used on a device that is running a version of Android &lt; 8.0, then an _implicit_ Intent is sufficient
        * the following configuration fields can be empty:
          - _Package Name_
          - _Class Name_
        * as a result, broadcast receivers in _all_ apps that match the _implicit_ Intent will be notified
  - broadcast any such bookmarked _Intent_ by either:
    * triggering manually
      - long click on the chosen _Intent_ to open its context menu
      - select: _Perform&hellip;_ &gt; _Send Broadcast_
    * scheduling an alarm
      - long click on the chosen _Intent_ to open its context menu
      - select: _Schedule&hellip;_
        * Perform = _Send Broadcast_
        * configure other settings: date, time, interval, precision, etc&hellip;

#### Credits:

* [AirPlay-Receiver-on-Android](https://github.com/gpfduoduo/AirPlay-Receiver-on-Android)
  - __brilliant__
  - what I like:
    * quality of code is excellent
    * implements much of the foundation for what I've described
      - [media player](https://github.com/yixia/VitamioBundle) used to render video URLs
      - _HttpCore_ web server that implements all _AirPlay_ video APIs
      - _jmDNS_ Bonjour registration
  - what I dislike:
    * all libraries are several years old
    * doesn't use _ExoPlayer_
    * the repo includes a lot of unused code
      - needs a little housekeeping
